 trade.1.title:0 "Re-evaluating our Trade with [trade_target.GetName]"
 trade.1.desc:0 "As relations degrade between [ROOT.GetName] and [trade_target.GetName], the bilateral trade relationship between our countries is affected. The [ROOT.GetAdjective]s have done much to harm relations and they could be punished through trade stipulations. However, limiting trade between our two countries could adversely harm our relationship. Our options are as follows; light sanctions, heavier sanctions, or a full embargo. Using any of these options could destroy or harm trade between our countries. Our advisors also warn that if we are to sanction/embargo them, they will likely do the same."

 trade.2.title:0 "[FROM.GetName] has put Light Sanctions on us!"
 trade.2.desc:0 "Likely due to the gradual collapse of [FROM.GetName]-[ROOT.GetName] relations, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have put minor sanctions on our country. This new stipulations have done nothing to repair our relations and only harms any hope of future bilateral trade. We are advised to put stipulations on trade as well, but if we have any hope of trading with [FROM.GetName] again, we should repair relations. If we are able to be percieved as a friend by [FROM.GetLeader], we may be able to trade with them once again. In the mean time, let us hope that we are able to get our resources from other countries."

The cut-off of trade has done nothing to repair our relations and only destroyes any hope of future bilateral trade. We are advised to put stipulations on trade as well, but if we have any hope of trading with [FROM.GetName] again, we should repair relations. If we are able to be percieved as a friend by [FROM.GetLeader], we may be able to trade with them once again.

 trade.5.title:0 "Re-evaluating our Trade with [trade_target.GetName]"
 trade.5.desc:0 "As relations improve between [ROOT.GetName] and [trade_target.GetName], we can hope to amend any trade wrong-doings of the past. The [ROOT.GetAdjective]s have done much to harm relations in the past, however with new amends and the improving of relations, many advisors hope and encourage the resuming of trade. However, lifting trade stipulations between our two countries would not necessarily mean that the [trade_target.GetAdjective]s would amend any embargoes or sanctions they have on us. It is a tricky situation, but we must do what's best for the future of bilateral relations."

This opens a new chapter for relations and bilateral investment and trade if we are willing. Although they have been willing enough to lift the trade limitations, is it a good idea to resume trade between our two countries? We are grateful to be using [FROM.GetAdjective] resources again, but should we be so quick to letthem use our precious resources? On the other hand, lifting any sanctions or embargoes we have would greatly improve relations."
